-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< EXAMPLE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- TODO: Remove the "--" from the below SELECT query and run the query
--    NOTE: When writing queries, make sure each one ends with a semi-colon


 



-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 1 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find out how many rows are in the table "final_airbnb"
-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 146

 SELECT * FROM final_airbnb;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 2 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find out the name of the host for "host_id" 63613
-- HINT: "Where" could it be?

SELECT host_name
FROM final_airbnb
WHERE host_id = "63613";

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: Patricia


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 3 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Query the data to just show the unique neighbourhoods listed
-- HINT: This is a "distinct" operation...

SELECT distinct neighbourhood, neighbourhood_group FROM final_airbnb;

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 40 neighbourhoods listed


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 4 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

-- Find both the highest price listing and the lowest price listing, displaying the entire row for each
-- HINT: This can be two different queries.

SELECT * FROM final_airbnb
ORDER BY price ASC;

SELECT * FROM final_airbnb
ORDER BY price DESC;



-- FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Think about the results. Are the high and low prices outliers in this data set?

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: Highest = 785, Lowest = 55


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 5 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the average availability for all listings in the data set (using the availability_365 column)
-- HINT: Aggregates are more than just big rocks...

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 165.3904

SELECT AVG(availability_365) as Average_availability_365 
FROM final_airbnb;


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 6 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find all listings that do NOT have a review
-- HINT: There are a few ways to go about this. Remember that an empty cell is "no value", but not necessarily NULL

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 6 rows

SELECT * FROM final_airbnb
WHERE number_of_reviews = 0;



-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 7 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the id of the listing with a room_type of "Private room" that has the most reviews 
-- HINT: Sorting is your friend!

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 58059

SELECT id FROM final_airbnb
WHERE room_type LIKE "Private room"
ORDER BY number_of_reviews DESC
LIMIT 1;


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 8 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the most popular neighbourhood for listings 
-- HINT: Look for which neighbourhood appears most frequently in the neighbourhood column
-- HINT: You are creating "summary rows" for each neighbourhood, so you will just see one entry for each neighbourhood

SELECT DISTINCT neighbourhood from final_airbnb
GROUP BY 







-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: Williamsburg
-- INVESTIGATE: Should Williamsburg be crowned the most popular neighbourhood?

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 9 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Query the data to discover which listing is the most popular using the reviews_per_month for all listings with a minimum_nights value of less than 7
-- HINT: Sorting is still your friend! So are constraints.

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 58059


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 10 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find out which host has the most listings. 
-- Create a NEW column that will show a calculation for how many listings the host for each listing has in the table
-- Display the column using aliasing.
-- HINT: Work this one step at a time. See if you can find a way to just display the count of listings per host first.

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: The Box House Hotel with 6 listings


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 11 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< WRAP UP >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- What do you think makes a successful AirBnB rental in this market? What factors seem to be at play the most?
-- Write a few sentences and include them with your project submission in the README file 

I think for a successful AirBnB rental in this market there needs to be adequate research on the location that gets the most traffic and the area that has the most attractions the city has to offfer.
Some factors i see that come to play the most are location, accessibility, the ammenitites offered at the property and pricing.


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ** BONUS ** >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the the percent above or below each listing is compared to the average price for all listings.
-- HINT: No hints! It's a bonus for a reason :)
